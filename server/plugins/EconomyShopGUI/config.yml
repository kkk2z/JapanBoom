config-version: 2.0.1.1
# WARNING: Do not change this value as this might end up in a plugin that does not work!!
#----------------------------------------------Language-------------------------------------------------

# Here you can change the language of the plugin.
language-file: lang-en.yml

# See this link for all available language files: https://gpplugins.gitbook.io/economyshopgui/file-configuration/languages#currently-supported-languages


#-----------------------------------------------Locale--------------------------------------------------

# The locale which will be used to format currencies.
# Examples:
# 'en-US' has a format of '#,##0.00'
# 'nl-NL' has a format of '#.##0,00'
locale: en-US

# Currency format
currency-format: '#,##0.00'

# Note: This is not the locale at which messages will be translated, see the above option for that.
# The locale is set in BCP 47 language tag.
# See this website for some example BCP 47 language tag you can use: https://appmakers.dev/bcp-47-language-codes-list/


#-----------------------------------------------Updates-------------------------------------------------

# This option enables or disables the automatic checking of updates for the plugin on startup or reload of the plugin
update-checking: true


#----------------------------------------------DebugMode------------------------------------------------

# Set this value to false to disable debug mode and do not send debug messages to the console.
debug: true

# When this option is true, nms will be used for item loading and opening shops
use-nms: true
# The benefit of using NMS is that test results prove that it is almost twice as fast for loading items/opening shops
# The plugin is always tested using NMS and so you should not need to disable this option
# The only reason why you would want to disable this is if you're experiencing version compatibility issues or if support tells you to do so


#---------------------------------------------Transactions----------------------------------------------

# Whether transactions should be logged to a text file
transaction-log: true


#-----------------------------------------------ShopStand-----------------------------------------------

# ShopStands allow physical stands to be placed down as blocks,
# allowing players to right/left-click the stand to purchase the item linked
shop-stands: false
# ShopStands is a separate module of the plugin, so when disabled, it will completely disable this feature and its listeners
# Due to its smart design, ShopStands aren't persistent(1.13+) unlike regular entities, and the impact on performance is minimal


#---------------------------------------DisabledCommandsInWorlds----------------------------------------

# The setting below enables or disables the disabled commands inside certain worlds feature
# When this option is true, the commands that are added to the world inside the list below will be disabled
enable-disabled-worlds: false

# List of commands with disabled worlds
# Each command has its own list of worlds that will be disabled.
# If a command is not added or the list with worlds for the specified command is empty,
# the command will work in every world.
disabled-worlds-per-command:

  shop:
  - 'testbuilding'

  sellall:
  - 'randompvp'

  editshop:
  - 'boss-fights'
  - 'Survival-Spawn'

# NOTE: Commands disabled inside worlds with the feature above will still be registered inside the server,
# meaning that a command still can conflict with the same command from another plugin.


#--------------------------------------------EconomyProvider--------------------------------------------

# Use this to set a different economy provider other than vault
# Supported economy types:
# VAULT = Economy API which requires a separate economy plugin to be installed like Essentials or CMI
# PLAYER_POINTS = Economy provider which supports MySQL
# GEMS_ECONOMY = Economy provider which supports multiple currencies using 'GEMS_ECONOMY:<currency>'
# ULTRA_ECONOMY = Economy provider which supports multiple currencies using 'ULTRA_ECONOMY:<currency>'
# COINS_ENGINE = Economy provider(formerly known as GamePoints) which supports multiple currencies using 'COINS_ENGINE:<currency>'
# VOTING_PLUGIN = Points economy from VotingPlugin
# EXP = Raw XP points used to enchant items
economy-provider: VAULT

# The economy provider above will be used for every item except when you specify a specific section economy.
# See our wiki here on how to use multiple economy's at the same time for specific sections:
# https://wiki.gpplugins.com/economyshopgui/file-configuration/sections.yml#specific-currency

# The formatted names for currency's
# Any currency's from GemsEconomy, UltraEconomy and CoinsEngine will use the formats when the currency was created/set by the economy plugin,
# though this can be overridden by setting it manually below per currency if desired
currency-formats:
  player-points:
    singular: Point
    plural: Points
    friendly: Points
  vault:
    singular: '%currency-symbol%'
    plural: '%currency-symbol%'
    friendly: money

    plural: Examples
    friendly: Examples


#--------------------------------------------SpawnerProvider--------------------------------------------

# Available values:
# DISABLED = This will disable both spawner place and break event which disables the spawner provider
# DEFAULT = The default spawner provider inside ESGUI, see the SpawnerSettings section in this config
# AUTO = Automatically searches for compatible spawner provider, if no provider was found, DEFAULT will be used
# SILKSPAWNERS = An external spawner provider created by Timbru
# SILKSPAWNERSV2 = An external spawner provider created by CandC_9_12
# WILDSTACKER = An external spawner provider that can stack/upgrade spawners
# ULTIMATESTACKER = An external spawner provider that can stack spawners
# ROSESTACKER = An external spawner provider that can stack spawners
# MINEABLESPAWNERS = An external spawner provider
# SPAWNERMETA = An external spawner provider that can stack/upgrade spawners
spawner-provider: AUTO
# NOTE: When there is no spawner provider set, the default will be used


#-----------------------------------------------DiscordSRV----------------------------------------------

# The DiscordSRV hook allows you to log transaction directly to a discord text channels in your guild when someone makes a transaction
enable-discordsrv-hook: false

# Note: The channel configured under the 'channel' option also needs to exist inside config.yml of DiscordSRV or this won't work

#------------------------------------------PlayerTransactions-------------------------------------------

# When this option is set to true, every time a player sells/buys something from the server, it will output it in the console.

log-player-transactions: true
# Set to false to disable this.

# This option sends an on-screen title to the player with the price of the items being bought/sold

# Should we drop the remaining items on the ground when the players inventory is full?
drop-remaining-items-on-ground: false
# When this option is false, the plugin will only give the items that fit inside the inventory and the remaining items will be cancelled. The player will only pay for the amount of items that fit inside the inventory.
# Warning: When this option is true, players could lag out your server by buying an insane amount of items that fall on the ground!

# Whether to sell shulker contents
# When false, shulker boxes inside the player's inventory when selling items won't be emptied/sold
# When true, the plugin will try to sell any item inside a shulker box when selling items via /sellall

# Note: This feature only loads textured player heads for shop items, navigation bars and transaction items,
# meaning that the bedrock player's head won't be loaded when using 'skullowner: %player_name%'
# Double note: Adding a new textured player head to shop when the server is running won't work, this requires a full server restart
