# This is an example shop file which is only a reference for how shop configs should be created in /shops/<shopName>.yml

# The file name defines the shop internal name and needs to match the filename for the section inside the sections folder
# Example:
# /shops/Blocks.yml -> /sections/Blocks.yml
# /shops/Z_EverythingElse.yml -> /sections/Z_EverythingElse.yml
#
# If this does not match, an example shop will be created with name '<shopName>.yml', so make sure it matches!

# The different pages inside this section
pages:
  page1:
    # The size of the GUI defined in rows, one row is 9 slots long.

    # In other words, this page will have a size of 36 slots BUT;
    # when this shop section has a navigation bar, the last row of the inventory will be 'reserved' for the navigation bar
    # making it so the inventory can only carry 27 shop items instead of 36.

    # Adding more items to this page which exceeds the size, will result in them not being able to load
